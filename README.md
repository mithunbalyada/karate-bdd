# my-api-test

This repository has Karate scenarios written to automate below web service. Tests are run as Junit test and JSON reports are generated by Karate parallel run. 

JSON reports are parsed into beautiful HTML reports using cluecumber report plugin. 

A sample report is available at _target/generated-report/index.html_


### How to run tests

Using maven

`mvn clean test cluecumber-report:reporting`

## 



## Given the following webservice,


`GET             http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees`

`POST           http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/create`
```json
